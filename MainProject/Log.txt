/*Group Meeting on 23.05.2017 Outcome*/

1- Add enable/disable sequence button:
	* a check box within the tab
	* the same value for the same tab in all windows (a sequence spans all cards)
	* change the color of the tab header based on the check value (green=checked, red=unchecked)
	* the choices should be saved within the model

2- Add a new kind of steps (Python Step):
	* You can specify a Python script in a pop-up editor and specify the duration in the same way other kinds of steps have.
	* In the script a special set of python variables are predefined:
		** "out" is the output value for the current time step
		** "t" represents the current time within the step measured in ms
		** "T" represents the whole duration of the step in ms
		** "t0" represents the absolute current time measured in ms
		** "u0" the value of the last time-step of the previous step (usually in Volts) // what if there is no previous step?
		** "u1" the value of the first time-step of the next step (usually in Volts) //what if there is no next step? 
							//or the next step is Python script that depends on the last step of this one (circular dependency)?
	* For each time-step contained in the step the output value is calculated based on the Python script.
